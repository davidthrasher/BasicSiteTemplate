# Basic Site Template

This is a repository created for those learning to code. It contains
boilerplate HTML and a simple file structure. The CSS and JS files have
been left empty intentionally. From here, you can build your HTML, start
styling it with CSS, and add JavaScript to create dynamic behavior.

Oh... and don't forget to have fun while you're doing it too!
